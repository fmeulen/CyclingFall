# Supplementary Online Material for "A Model Based On Cyclist Fall Experiments Which Predicts The Maximum Allowable Handlebar Disturbance From Which A Cyclist Can Recover Balance"
The PDF "SOM_A_model_based_on_cyclist_fall_experiments" presents an overview of the experimental data that can be found in this repository, detailed information on the statistical analyses conducted, as well as recommendations for future research directions that extend beyond the scope of the main paper. Additionally, it includes several aspects of our study with practical applications that go beyond the modeling emphasis of the main paper.

The script "cycling_fall_figs_for_article.R" produces the analyses and figures within the article.

The script "cycling_fall_full_analysis.Rmd" is an R-markdown file which does the full analysis but also contains extra exploratory figures and fitted models. 
When run, it produces the file "cycling_fall_full_analysis.Rmd.html".
